                    <h1> About</h1>
                    <strong><small>Background, Hobbies and Values</small></strong>
                    <p>I come from a rather fortunate background, and have made full use of all my advantages. From a young age I was determined to give me all to the task I wanted to do. From ages 6-14 it was gymnastics and I placed in state for North Carolina and trained with olympians in switzerland. From highschool, I focused on my studies for an oppurtunity at a nice college. However, I ended up volunteering the Air Force as a Communication Equipment Engineer. I specialized in satellite communication maintanence and operations for most of my career. After my 4 year enlistment I went full time to the University of Maryland University College, where I achieved a Bachelors of Science in Finance after 2 years. At 25 I plan to continue my education through the Coding Temple Program and to put The most Effort I can into the experience. </p>
                    <p>My Hobbies are diverse and I approach my hobbies with the same competitiveness as my life. I have always loved the computer and throughout highschool I played dota 2 and achieved a rank of Divine 5. I still play casually, but my interests have shifted to the piano. I started to self teach at 23 years old and was able to learn classics like "Fur Elise" and "Grande Valse Brillante". At the age of 25 I am now under the guidance of a concert pianist, and plan to continue my education with Mr. Emata until I can obtain enough competency to self teach. </p>
                    <p>My values are very simple. I value high integrity (which was only enforced by the military), high trust, and high work ethic. I am here for a short time on earth, and I have known from a young age that I want to achieve as much as possible during this time.  </p>
